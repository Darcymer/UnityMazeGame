# Overview

This project was designed to be able to tell me understand how a game development IDE, game development code, and the workings of game design are able to create a project that allows for a game to be made. I spent the last few weeks reading understanding and analyzing all aspects of unity to understand how it works and how it can be used to create fun immersive user experiences.

This project that I worked on is a small demo that allows for a character to move around in an maze, and eventually reach the goal at the end.

# Development Environment

The IDE used was Unity 3D, as well as Unity Hub to access my project. I also utilized __ to write my code.

The code I used for this project was C#, and the libaries utilized were from unity to use their systems to make my code.

# Future Work

* Implement code to allow my character to shoot and destroy the targets
* Implement more levels the playter can go to to, using the level sender asset to move the character from one Scene to another.
* Implement a border to be able to respawn the player at a certain area incase the player falls our of bounds.
* Create a maze that allows for the user to navigate to the targets.
